**KASHMIR SHAIVISM: DETAILED SYSTEM**

Modern definition:
Kashmir Shaivism is a non-dualistic philosophical and practical tradition (c. 8th–12th centuries CE) from the Kashmir region that developed sophisticated understanding of consciousness, energy, and kundalini, producing key texts like the Shiva Sutras, Spanda Karikas, and Vijnana Bhairava Tantra that contain detailed methods for consciousness transformation.

Historical roots:
Kashmir Shaivism emerged in the 8th–9th centuries CE in the Kashmir Valley, synthesizing earlier Shaiva and Tantric traditions. Key figures include Vasugupta (8th century), who received the Shiva Sutras, Abhinavagupta (10th–11th centuries), who systematized the philosophy, and others. The tradition flourished until the 12th century when Islamic invasions disrupted it. Some knowledge was preserved in texts and remaining lineages, though much was lost.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Sanskrit: काश्मीर शैवदर्शन (Kāśmīra Śaivadarśana) - "Kashmir Shaiva philosophy"
- Also called: त्रिक (Trika) - "triad" system
- Key texts:
  - शिवसूत्र (Śivasūtra) - Shiva Sutras
  - स्पन्दकारिका (Spandakārikā) - Spanda Karikas
  - विज्ञानभैरवतन्त्र (Vijñānabhairavatantra) - Vijnana Bhairava Tantra

How it was lost:
Kashmir Shaivism knowledge was lost through: (1) Disruption during Islamic invasions (12th–14th centuries), (2) Destruction of texts and learning centers, (3) Loss of oral transmission when lineages were broken, (4) The sophisticated philosophy was preserved in texts but practical methods were largely lost, and (5) Modern academic study focuses on philosophy while practical applications remain understudied.

Ties to the book:
Kashmir Shaivism represents one of the most sophisticated developments of kundalini understanding, showing how philosophy and practice were integrated, while also demonstrating how even highly developed systems can be largely lost when transmission is disrupted.
