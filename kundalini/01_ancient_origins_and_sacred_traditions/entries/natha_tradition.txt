**NATHA TRADITION**

Modern definition:
The Natha tradition is a medieval Indian yogic lineage (c. 10th–15th centuries CE) that preserved and systematized much of the practical kundalini knowledge, producing key texts like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and developing systematic methods for energy work that became foundational for later yoga traditions.

Historical roots:
The Natha tradition emerged around the 10th century CE, founded by Matsyendranath and developed by his disciple Gorakshanath (Gorakhnath). The tradition synthesized earlier Tantric and yogic practices, creating systematic methods for kundalini awakening. Key texts include the Goraksha Samhita, Hatha Yoga Pradipika, and various Natha texts. The tradition was preserved through lineages of yogis (Nathas) who maintained both written texts and oral transmission. Many lineages were disrupted during periods of persecution, though some continue today.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Sanskrit: नाथ सम्प्रदाय (Nātha Sampradāya) - "Natha tradition"
- Practitioners: नाथ (Nātha) - "lord," "master"
- Founder: मत्स्येन्द्रनाथ (Matsyendranath)
- Key figure: गोरक्षनाथ (Gorakshanath/Gorakhnath)

How it was lost:
Natha knowledge was lost through: (1) Disruption of lineages during periods of persecution and social change, (2) The detailed practical techniques were kept in oral transmission and lost when teacher-student relationships were broken, (3) Many texts were destroyed or lost, and (4) Modern yoga adopted Natha practices but lost the complete system and spiritual context, reducing them to physical exercise.

Ties to the book:
The Natha tradition represents a crucial bridge between ancient kundalini knowledge and modern yoga, showing how systematic methods were developed and preserved, while also demonstrating how complete systems can be fragmented and lost when transmission is disrupted.
