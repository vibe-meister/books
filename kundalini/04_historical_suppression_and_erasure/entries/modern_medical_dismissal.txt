**MODERN MEDICAL DISMISSAL OF KUNDALINI**

Modern definition:
The systematic dismissal of kundalini experiences and practices by modern medical and psychiatric systems, which have often misdiagnosed kundalini awakening as mental illness, dismissed energy work as "unscientific," and failed to understand the physiological basis of these experiences, leading to inappropriate treatment and further suppression of knowledge.

Historical roots:
Modern medicine's dismissal of kundalini began in the 19th century when Western medicine established itself as the authoritative system, dismissing all "alternative" approaches. Early psychiatrists like Carl Jung recognized kundalini-like phenomena, but mainstream medicine largely ignored or pathologized these experiences. The situation improved somewhat in the late 20th century as research on meditation and yoga began, but kundalini experiences are still often misdiagnosed, and energy work remains largely outside mainstream medicine.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Medical terms: "psychosis," "mania," "conversion disorder," "somatic symptom disorder"
- Dismissive terms: "unscientific," "placebo," "superstition"

How it was lost:
Medical dismissal of kundalini occurred through: (1) Pathologizing of kundalini experiences as mental illness, (2) Dismissal of energy work as "unscientific" without investigation, (3) Lack of medical education about these phenomena, (4) Inappropriate treatment of people having kundalini experiences, and (5) Failure to integrate traditional knowledge with modern medicine, creating a gap that prevents proper understanding and care.

Ties to the book:
Modern medical dismissal represents a contemporary form of suppression that continues to erase kundalini knowledge by pathologizing experiences, dismissing practices, and preventing proper understanding and integration of this knowledge into healthcare systems.

MEDICAL DISMISSAL MECHANISMS

How medicine dismisses kundalini:

"UNSCIENTIFIC" LABEL:
- Dismissal without investigation

- No framework for understanding
- Knowledge gap

INSTITUTIONAL BIAS:
- Medical system structure
- Pharmaceutical focus
- Procedure-oriented
- Missing holistic understanding

RESEARCH GAPS:
- Limited studies
- Funding challenges
- Academic bias
- Slow progress

EFFECTS OF DISMISSAL

- Inappropriate medication

KNOWLEDGE LOSS:
- Practices not studied
- Experiences not understood
- Integration prevented
- Knowledge gap widens

HEALTHCARE GAPS:
- Missing treatment options
- Incomplete care
- Lost opportunities
- System limitations

SOCIAL IMPACT:
- Stigma continues
- Fear of experiences
- Lack of support
- Isolation

CHANGING ATTITUDES

- Building bridges

The modern medical dismissal of kundalini represents a contemporary form of suppression that continues to affect individuals and prevent proper understanding. While attitudes are slowly changing as research accumulates, significant gaps remain in medical education, understanding, and integration of this knowledge into healthcare systems. Addressing these gaps is essential for proper care and complete understanding of human consciousness and transformation.
