**MUDRAS AND BANDHAS: ENERGY LOCKS AND GESTURES**

Modern definition:
Mudras are hand gestures, body positions, and energy seals that direct and contain prana (life force), while bandhas are energy locks that seal and channel energy in specific ways. Together, they are advanced techniques for working with kundalini energy, directing its flow, and supporting safe awakening and integration.

Historical roots:
Mudras and bandhas are described in classical texts like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika (15th century CE), Gheranda Samhita (17th century CE), and various Tantric texts. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika describes ten mudras and three bandhas, emphasizing their importance for kundalini awakening. These techniques were traditionally taught only to advanced students after years of preparation, and the most detailed knowledge was kept in oral transmission within secret lineages.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Sanskrit: मुद्रा (mudrā) - "seal," "gesture," "sign"
- Sanskrit: बन्ध (bandha) - "lock," "bond," "binding"
- Key mudras:
  - महामुद्रा (mahāmudrā) - great seal
  - खेचरी मुद्रा (khecarī mudrā) - tongue lock
  - विपरीत करणी (viparīta karaṇī) - inverted action
- Key bandhas:
  - मूल बन्ध (mūla bandha) - root lock
  - उड्डियान बन्ध (uḍḍiyāna bandha) - flying up lock
  - जालन्धर बन्ध (jālandhara bandha) - throat lock

How it was lost:
The detailed techniques and proper application of mudras and bandhas were lost because: (1) These advanced techniques require direct transmission from teacher to student, and many lineages were disrupted, (2) The subtle techniques and timing were kept in oral tradition and never fully written down, (3) Modern yoga largely ignores mudras and bandhas or teaches them incorrectly without understanding their energy work purpose, and (4) The integration of mudras and bandhas with pranayama and other practices for kundalini work was lost when the complete system was fragmented.

Ties to the book:
Mudras and bandhas represent some of the most advanced and powerful kundalini techniques, yet they are also among the most lost, demonstrating how the most sophisticated knowledge was the most vulnerable to loss when oral transmission was disrupted.
