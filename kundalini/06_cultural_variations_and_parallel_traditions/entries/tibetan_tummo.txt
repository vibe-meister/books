**TIBETAN TUMMO (INNER HEAT)**

Modern definition:
Tummo (གཏུམ་མོ, gtum mo) is a Tibetan Buddhist practice for generating inner heat and awakening transformative energy, corresponding closely to kundalini practices. The techniques involve specific breathing, visualization, and energy work methods that produce measurable heat and consciousness transformation.

Historical roots:
Tummo practices appear in Tibetan Buddhist texts from the 8th century CE onwards, particularly in the Six Yogas of Naropa and related practices. The techniques were preserved in Tibetan Buddhist lineages, particularly in the Kagyu and Gelug schools. Western researchers like Herbert Benson and others have studied tummo practitioners, documenting measurable physiological effects including increased body temperature and changes in metabolism.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Tibetan: གཏུམ་མོ (gtum mo) - "fierce woman" or "inner heat"
- Sanskrit equivalent: चण्डाली (caṇḍālī) - "fierce one"
- Alternative: ནང་མེ (nang me) - "inner fire"

How it was lost:
Tummo knowledge was lost through: (1) Suppression of Tibetan Buddhism during Chinese occupation, (2) The detailed techniques were kept in secret transmission and lost when lineages were disrupted, (3) The practices require extensive preparation and teacher guidance that was lost when transmission was broken, and (4) Modern interpretations reduced tummo to basic visualization without understanding the complete energy work system.

Ties to the book:
Tummo represents how the same transformative energy knowledge appears across different Buddhist and Hindu traditions, showing universal understanding while also demonstrating how knowledge was suppressed across multiple cultures.

CORRESPONDENCES WITH KUNDALINI

Similarities to kundalini practices:

ENERGY CONCEPT:
- Inner heat = Kundalini energy
- Transformative power
- Consciousness change
- Similar understanding

TECHNIQUES:
- Breathwork similar
- Energy channel work
- Visualization methods
- Integration practices

EFFECTS:
- Heat generation
- Consciousness transformation
- Physiological changes
- Spiritual realization

LOST KNOWLEDGE

Much detailed knowledge was lost:

ADVANCED METHODS:
- Sophisticated techniques
- Complete systems
- Integration methods
- Refinements

PRACTICAL GUIDANCE:
- Teacher transmission
- Individual adaptation
- Timing and sequencing
- Safety protocols

The tummo system represents another parallel tradition with kundalini, showing the universal nature of this knowledge while also demonstrating how it was suppressed across cultures.
