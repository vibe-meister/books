**INTEGRATION METHODS FOR KUNDALINI AWAKENING**

Modern definition:
Specific techniques, practices, and approaches for integrating kundalini awakening experiences into daily life, supporting the reorganization process, and ensuring safe, stable integration of transformation. Integration is essential for making awakening beneficial rather than disruptive.

Historical roots:
Classical texts emphasize the importance of integration, but detailed methods were largely kept in oral transmission and lost when lineages were disrupted. Modern understanding combines classical principles with psychological and medical knowledge to support integration.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Sanskrit: समन्वय (samanvaya) - "integration," "harmonization"
- Related: स्थिरीकरण (sthirīkaraṇa) - "stabilization"

How it was lost:
Integration methods were lost because: (1) Detailed techniques were kept in oral transmission and lost when lineages were disrupted, (2) Classical texts mention integration but assume teacher guidance, (3) Modern practitioners often lack access to this knowledge, and (4) The integration of classical methods with modern understanding is incomplete.

Ties to the book:
Integration methods represent crucial practical knowledge that was largely lost, showing how the most important supportive techniques were vulnerable to loss when oral transmission was broken.
