**CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR KUNDALINI PRACTICE**

Modern definition:
Specific conditions, circumstances, and individual factors that make kundalini practices inappropriate, dangerous, or requiring special modification. Understanding contraindications is essential for safe practice and preventing harm.

Historical roots:
Classical texts contain warnings about who should and shouldn't practice, what conditions require caution, and when practices are inappropriate. However, much of this detailed knowledge was kept in oral transmission and lost when lineages were disrupted. Modern understanding combines classical warnings with medical knowledge and psychological understanding.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Sanskrit: निषेध (niṣedha) - "prohibition," "contraindication"
- Warnings in texts about: अयोग्य (ayogya) - "unsuitable," "inappropriate"

How it was lost:
Detailed contraindication knowledge was lost because: (1) Much was kept in oral transmission and lost when lineages were disrupted, (2) Classical texts contain warnings but assume prior knowledge from teachers, (3) Modern practitioners often lack access to this knowledge, and (4) The integration of classical warnings with modern medical understanding is incomplete.

Ties to the book:
Contraindications represent crucial safety knowledge that was largely lost, demonstrating how the most important practical information was vulnerable to loss when oral transmission was disrupted.
