**WARNING SIGNS DURING KUNDALINI PRACTICE**

Modern definition:
Specific physical, psychological, and energetic signs that indicate problems during kundalini practice, requiring adjustment of practice, seeking guidance, or professional help. Recognizing warning signs is essential for safe practice and preventing harm.

Historical roots:
Classical texts contain warnings about problems that can arise, but detailed knowledge of warning signs was largely kept in oral transmission and lost when lineages were disrupted. Modern understanding combines classical warnings with medical and psychological knowledge to identify when practice is causing problems rather than supporting transformation.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Sanskrit: सावधान (sāvadhāna) - "caution," "warning"
- Related: व्याधि (vyādhi) - "disease," "disorder"

How it was lost:
Warning sign knowledge was lost because: (1) Detailed recognition methods were kept in oral transmission and lost when lineages were disrupted, (2) Classical texts mention problems but assume teacher guidance for recognition, (3) Modern practitioners often lack access to this knowledge, and (4) Integration of classical warnings with modern medical understanding is incomplete.

Ties to the book:
Warning signs represent crucial safety knowledge that was largely lost, demonstrating how the most important practical information for preventing harm was vulnerable to loss when oral transmission was broken.
