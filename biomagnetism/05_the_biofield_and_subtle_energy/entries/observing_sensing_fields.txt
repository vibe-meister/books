**OBSERVING AND SENSING MAGNETIC FIELDS**

Modern definition:
Methods for detecting, sensing, and observing one's own magnetic fields and the fields of others, ranging from scientific measurement with instruments (MCG, MEG, SQUID sensors) to subjective sensing techniques developed in ancient traditions. Research shows that with training, individuals can develop sensitivity to field changes through body awareness, energy sensations, and intuitive perception, though scientific measurement provides objective validation.

Historical roots:
Ancient traditions worldwide developed methods for sensing "energy fields" or "auras," including practices in India (prana sensing), China (qi perception), and various healing traditions. These were developed through careful training and observation over thousands of years. Modern scientific measurement began in the 1960s with SQUID technology, providing objective methods for field observation. The integration of subjective sensing with scientific measurement is still developing.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Sanskrit: प्राण अनुभव (prāṇa anubhava) - experiencing prana/energy
- Chinese: 感氣 (gǎnqì) - sensing qi/energy
- Related: aura perception, energy sensing, field awareness

How it was lost:
The detailed techniques for sensing fields were lost because: (1) Much was kept in oral transmission and lost when lineages were disrupted, (2) Modern science dismissed subjective sensing as "unscientific" without investigating the underlying phenomena, (3) The integration of subjective and objective methods was prevented by scientific bias, and (4) Training methods for developing sensitivity were lost when traditions were suppressed.

Ties to the book:
The ability to observe and sense magnetic fields represents both ancient knowledge (subjective sensing) and modern capability (scientific measurement). Understanding both methods enables complete field awareness and work.

Observing and sensing magnetic fields is possible through both scientific measurement (MCG, MEG, HRV devices) and subjective sensing methods (body awareness, hand sensitivity, intuitive perception). While scientific measurement provides objective data, subjective sensing can be developed through training and offers practical, accessible methods for daily field awareness. The integration of both approaches enables complete field observation and work, combining the precision of scientific measurement with the accessibility of trained perception.
