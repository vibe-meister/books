**INCREASING MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH**

Modern definition:
Specific practices and techniques that can increase the strength and coherence of the magnetic fields produced by the heart, brain, and body. Research shows that practices like coherent breathing, heart-focused meditation, physical exercise, and certain emotional states can increase heart rate variability (indicating stronger, more coherent heart fields) and alter brain field patterns, demonstrating that field strength can be intentionally enhanced.

Historical roots:
Ancient traditions worldwide developed practices for "increasing energy" or "strengthening the life force," including qigong, pranayama, and various energy cultivation practices. These were developed through careful observation of effects on health, performance, and consciousness. Modern research beginning in the 1990s has documented how specific practices increase HRV and alter brain activity, corresponding to stronger, more coherent field patterns.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Sanskrit: प्राण वृद्धि (prāṇa vṛddhi) - increasing prana/energy
- Chinese: 增強氣場 (zēngqiáng qìchǎng) - strengthening the field
- Related: energy cultivation, field strengthening practices

How it was lost:
The connection between specific practices and magnetic field strength increase was lost because: (1) Ancient practitioners described effects in energy terms without understanding magnetic mechanisms, (2) The detailed techniques were kept in oral transmission and lost when lineages were disrupted, (3) Modern science only recently developed instruments to measure field strength changes, and (4) The integration of field-strengthening practices with magnetic understanding is still developing.

Ties to the book:
The ability to increase magnetic field strength represents a practical application of biomagnetism knowledge. Understanding which practices strengthen fields enables intentional optimization for health, performance, and consciousness development.
