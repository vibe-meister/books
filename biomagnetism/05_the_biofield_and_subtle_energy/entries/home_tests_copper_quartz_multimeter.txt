**HOME TESTS: COPPER WIRE, QUARTZ, AND MULTIMETER**

Modern definition:
Simple, safe home experiments using copper wire, quartz crystals, and a multimeter to explore electrical and electromagnetic properties that may relate to biomagnetic fields. These tests allow basic investigation of material properties and potential field interactions without expensive equipment.

Historical roots:
Home experimentation with materials for energy work has been practiced informally for decades, though systematic testing methods are less documented. Modern understanding of electrical properties enables basic home tests, though direct biomagnetic field measurement requires specialized equipment. These home tests explore related electrical phenomena that may correlate with field effects.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Modern terms: Home experiments, DIY testing
- No ancient equivalent (modern materials and tools)

How it was lost:
Home testing methods weren't "lost" but rather were never systematically documented. However: (1) Practical testing knowledge was often kept informal, (2) The connection between electrical tests and biomagnetic fields wasn't understood, and (3) Systematic home testing methods weren't developed or shared widely.

Ties to the book:
Home tests represent accessible ways to explore material properties and potential field interactions, making biomagnetism research more accessible to individuals without expensive equipment. While these tests measure electrical rather than magnetic properties directly, they explore related phenomena.
