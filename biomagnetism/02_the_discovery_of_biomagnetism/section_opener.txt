SECTION 2: THE DISCOVERY OF BIOMAGNETISM

What if I told you that the magnetic fields produced by your heart and brain were only discovered in the 1960s, despite the fact that your heart generates a magnetic field 100,000 times stronger than the Earth's magnetic field at your body's surface? You have probably never heard that biomagnetism—the study of magnetic fields produced by living organisms—represents one of the most recent and least-known branches of science, emerging only when technology became sensitive enough to measure these incredibly weak fields.

Imagine that for most of human history, the magnetic fields produced by your body were completely invisible to science. The instruments simply didn't exist. It wasn't until the development of SQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices) in the 1960s that scientists could finally measure the magnetic signals from the heart and brain—signals that had been described in different language by ancient traditions for thousands of years.

This section reveals the discovery of biomagnetism: how scientists first detected magnetic fields from the human body, the technological breakthroughs that made measurement possible, the early research that established the field, and the ongoing discoveries that continue to expand our understanding. You'll discover that biomagnetism is a remarkably young science, still in its early stages, with much remaining to be discovered.

The story of biomagnetism's discovery is also a story of what was missed. For centuries, healers, mystics, and practitioners of various traditions described phenomena that we now know correspond to magnetic fields. But without the ability to measure them, these observations were dismissed. The discovery of biomagnetism represents science finally catching up to observations made millennia earlier.

Yet even with modern instruments, biomagnetism remains a marginal field. The equipment is expensive, the measurements are difficult, and the applications are still being developed. Much of what ancient practitioners observed remains to be fully measured and understood with modern technology.

In this section, you'll encounter the pioneers of biomagnetism, the technological breakthroughs that made the field possible, the early discoveries that established it, and the ongoing research that continues to reveal the magnetic nature of life.

How to use this section:
The entries in this section are organized alphabetically by discovery, technology, or key figure. Each entry explores how biomagnetism was discovered, what technologies made it possible, and what we've learned about the magnetic fields produced by the human body. Read these entries to understand both the scientific discovery and how it validates ancient observations that were previously dismissed.
