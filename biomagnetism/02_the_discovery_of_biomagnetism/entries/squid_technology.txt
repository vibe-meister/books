**SQUID TECHNOLOGY: ENABLING BIOMAGNETISM**

Modern definition:
SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) is an extremely sensitive magnetometer that can detect magnetic fields billions of times weaker than the Earth's magnetic field, making it possible to measure the magnetic signals from the human heart and brain. Without SQUID technology, biomagnetism research would be impossible.

Historical roots:
SQUID technology was developed in the 1960s, building on the discovery of superconductivity and the Josephson effect. The first practical SQUID magnetometer was developed by James Zimmerman and others at Ford Research Laboratories in the late 1960s. This breakthrough made it possible to measure the incredibly weak magnetic fields produced by biological systems for the first time. The technology has continued to improve, with modern SQUIDs being among the most sensitive detectors ever created.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Modern term: SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device)
- No ancient equivalent (technology didn't exist)

How it was lost:
SQUID technology wasn't "lost" but rather didn't exist until the 1960s. However, the knowledge gap represents how: (1) Ancient observations of magnetic phenomena couldn't be verified without sensitive instruments, (2) The delay in developing measurement technology meant that detailed ancient knowledge was dismissed before it could be validated, (3) The high cost and complexity of SQUID technology has limited research, keeping biomagnetism a marginal field, and (4) Much ancient knowledge about working with these fields was lost during the centuries when they couldn't be measured.

Ties to the book:
SQUID technology represents the breakthrough that finally made it possible to measure what ancient practitioners had observed for millennia. Its development demonstrates how technological limitations can prevent validation of accurate observations, and how the delay in developing measurement tools contributed to the loss of ancient knowledge.
