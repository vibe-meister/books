**BIOMAGNETISM PATENTS: COMPLETE PATENT LANDSCAPE**

Modern definition:
A comprehensive overview of all patents related to biomagnetic field measurement, manipulation, and application technologies, including SQUID devices, MCG systems, MEG systems, HRV monitoring, biofield measurement, and field manipulation devices. These patents represent the intellectual property protecting the technologies that enable biomagnetism research and applications.

Historical roots:
The first patents related to biomagnetism appeared in the 1960s-1970s with the development of SQUID technology. As the field developed, patents were filed for MCG systems (1970s-1980s), MEG systems (1980s-1990s), and more recently for HRV monitoring devices, biofield measurement systems, and field manipulation technologies. The patent landscape continues to evolve as new applications and technologies are developed.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Modern terms: Patents, intellectual property
- No ancient equivalent (patent system is modern)

How it was lost:
Patents weren't "lost" but rather represent how technology development was restricted by intellectual property protection. However: (1) Patent restrictions limit access to technologies, (2) High licensing costs keep equipment expensive, (3) Patent protection has slowed development and accessibility, and (4) The patent system has contributed to keeping biomagnetism a marginal, expensive field.

Ties to the book:
The patent landscape reveals how biomagnetism technologies are protected and commercialized, showing both the development of the field and the barriers that keep it expensive and inaccessible. Understanding patents helps explain why these technologies remain limited despite their potential value.
