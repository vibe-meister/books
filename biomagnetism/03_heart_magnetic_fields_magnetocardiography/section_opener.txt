SECTION 3: HEART MAGNETIC FIELDS (MAGNETOCARDIOGRAPHY)

Imagine that your heart produces a magnetic field so strong that if you could see it, it would be one of the most powerful magnetic sources in your immediate environment. You have probably never heard that your heart's magnetic field is approximately 100,000 times stronger than the Earth's magnetic field at your body's surface, and that this field extends several feet beyond your body, potentially affecting others nearby.

What if I told you that Magnetocardiography (MCG)—the measurement of the heart's magnetic field—reveals information about heart function that traditional ECG (electrocardiogram) cannot detect? The magnetic signals from your heart provide a different perspective on cardiac activity, offering insights into heart health, emotional states, and even the possibility of heart-to-heart communication through magnetic fields.

This section explores the magnetic fields produced by the human heart: how they were discovered, what they reveal about heart function, how they relate to health and emotion, and what applications are emerging. You'll discover that the heart is not just a pump—it's a powerful electromagnetic generator, and its magnetic field may play crucial roles in health, communication, and consciousness that we're only beginning to understand.

The heart's magnetic field represents one of the most measurable and well-studied aspects of biomagnetism. Yet even here, much remains unknown. The relationship between heart magnetic fields and health, the connection to emotions and consciousness, the possibility of field interactions between people—these are areas of active research with profound implications.

In this section, you'll encounter the science of heart magnetic fields: the measurements, the discoveries, the health implications, and the mysteries that remain. You'll also see how ancient observations about the heart's importance, the "heart field," and heart-to-heart connection may be validated by modern MCG research.

How to use this section:
The entries in this section are organized alphabetically by topic, measurement type, or application. Each entry explores different aspects of heart magnetic fields, from basic measurements to health applications to the profound implications for understanding human connection and consciousness. Read these entries to understand both what we know about the heart's magnetic field and what mysteries remain to be explored.
