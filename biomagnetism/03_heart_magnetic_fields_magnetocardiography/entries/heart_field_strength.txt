**HEART MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH**

Modern definition:
The human heart produces a magnetic field with a strength of approximately 10^-10 tesla (0.1 nanotesla) at the body's surface, making it about 100,000 times stronger than the Earth's magnetic field at the same location. This field extends several feet beyond the body and varies with each heartbeat, providing rich information about cardiac function.

Historical roots:
The heart's magnetic field was first measured in 1963 by Gerhard Baule and Richard McFee using induction coils, though the measurements were very crude. The development of SQUID technology in the late 1960s made accurate measurement possible. David Cohen at MIT made the first SQUID measurements of the heart's magnetic field in 1970, establishing Magnetocardiography (MCG) as a field. Research has continued to refine measurements and explore applications.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Modern term: Heart magnetic field, MCG signal
- Related ancient concepts:
  - Chinese: 心氣 (xīnqì) - heart qi, heart energy
  - Sanskrit: अनाहत (anāhata) - heart chakra, relates to heart field

How it was lost:
The heart's magnetic field wasn't "lost" but rather couldn't be measured until the 1960s. However: (1) Ancient observations about the heart's "energy field" and importance were dismissed because they couldn't be measured, (2) The detailed understanding of heart fields in various traditions was lost when these observations were dismissed as unscientific, (3) The relationship between heart fields and health, emotion, and connection couldn't be studied scientifically until measurement was possible, and (4) Much knowledge about working with heart fields was lost during centuries when they were considered "mystical."

Ties to the book:
The heart's magnetic field strength demonstrates that what ancient traditions called the "heart field" or "heart energy" corresponds to a real, measurable magnetic phenomenon. The delay in being able to measure it contributed to the dismissal and loss of ancient knowledge about the heart's importance beyond its pumping function.

The heart's magnetic field strength demonstrates that the heart is a powerful electromagnetic generator, not just a mechanical pump. The field's strength and extension suggest it may play important roles in health, communication, and consciousness that we're only beginning to understand. Ancient observations about the heart's "energy field" are being validated by modern measurements, showing that what was called "mystical" corresponds to real, measurable magnetic phenomena.
