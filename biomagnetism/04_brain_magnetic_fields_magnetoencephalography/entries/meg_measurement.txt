**MEG: MEASURING BRAIN MAGNETIC FIELDS**

Modern definition:
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures the magnetic fields produced by neural activity in the brain. Using SQUID sensors, MEG can detect magnetic fields as weak as 10^-15 tesla (femtotesla), providing millisecond temporal resolution of brain activity with millimeter spatial resolution.

Historical roots:
The first measurement of brain magnetic fields was made by David Cohen at MIT in 1968, just after SQUID technology became available. Early MEG systems had single sensors; modern systems use hundreds of SQUID sensors arranged in helmet-like arrays. MEG technology has advanced significantly since the 1970s, with improvements in sensor arrays, signal processing, and source localization. The field has grown from basic research to clinical applications in epilepsy, brain mapping, and cognitive neuroscience.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Modern term: MEG, Magnetoencephalography
- Related ancient concepts:
  - Sanskrit: मनस (manas) - mind, relates to mental fields
  - Chinese: 神 (shén) - spirit, consciousness, relates to mental energy

How it was lost:
Brain magnetic fields weren't "lost" but rather couldn't be measured until the 1960s. However: (1) Ancient observations about "mental energy," "mind fields," and consciousness were dismissed because they couldn't be measured, (2) The detailed understanding of mental fields in various traditions was lost when these observations were considered unscientific, (3) The relationship between mental fields and consciousness, perception, and cognition couldn't be studied scientifically until measurement was possible, and (4) Much knowledge about working with mental fields was lost during centuries when they were considered "mystical."

Ties to the book:
MEG measurement demonstrates that what ancient traditions called "mental energy" or "consciousness fields" may correspond to real, measurable magnetic phenomena. The ability to measure brain magnetic fields validates ancient observations while revealing new understanding of the magnetic nature of mind and consciousness.
