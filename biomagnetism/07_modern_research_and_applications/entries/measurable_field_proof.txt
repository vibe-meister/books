**MEASURABLE PROOF OF BIOMAGNETIC FIELDS**

Modern definition:
Concrete, measurable evidence that the human body produces magnetic fields, documented through scientific instruments like SQUID magnetometers, MCG (Magnetocardiography), and MEG (Magnetoencephalography). This proof demonstrates that biomagnetic fields are not theoretical but real, measurable physical phenomena.

Historical roots:
The first measurement of heart magnetic fields was made in 1963 by Gerhard Baule and Richard McFee using induction coils. The development of SQUID technology in the late 1960s enabled accurate measurement. David Cohen at MIT made the first SQUID measurements of heart fields in 1970 and brain fields in 1968. Since then, thousands of measurements have been made, providing definitive proof of biomagnetic fields.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Modern scientific terms: MCG, MEG, biomagnetic fields
- No ancient equivalent (couldn't be measured)

How it was lost:
Biomagnetic fields weren't "lost" but rather couldn't be measured until the 1960s. However: (1) Ancient observations of "energy fields" were dismissed because they couldn't be measured, (2) The delay in developing measurement technology meant ancient knowledge was lost before validation was possible, and (3) The high cost of measurement equipment has kept the field marginal, limiting public awareness.

Ties to the book:
Measurable proof of biomagnetic fields validates ancient observations while demonstrating that what was called "mystical" corresponds to real, measurable physical phenomena. This proof is the foundation for understanding field manipulation.

The measurable proof of biomagnetic fields is overwhelming and definitive. Through millions of measurements using SQUID technology, MCG, and MEG systems, science has conclusively demonstrated that the human body produces magnetic fields. The heart field (10^-10 tesla, extending several feet) and brain field (10^-13 tesla) are real, measurable physical phenomena, not theoretical concepts. This proof validates ancient observations while providing the scientific foundation for understanding field manipulation and biofield work.
