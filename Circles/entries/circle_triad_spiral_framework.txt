**CIRCLE–TRIAD–SPIRAL FRAMEWORK**

Modern definition:
This entry introduces what we will call a **Circle–Triad–Spiral (CTS) system**: a recurrent process represented by (1) circular phase, (2) triadic sector state (−1/0/+1), and (3) radial drift (spiral in/out), with optional couplings between multiple such circles. The CTS formalism is not new physics, but a **novel packaging and extension**: it defines a specific kind of embedding (a “CTS embedding”) and a set of quantitative invariants that can be applied consistently across physical, biological, psychological, and symbolic cycles, turning the slogan “everything is circles” into a reusable mathematical template.

Historical roots:
The ingredients come from well-established mathematics and physics: uniform circular motion and trigonometry (ancient Greek geometry), complex numbers and Euler’s formula (18th–19th centuries), Fourier series and harmonic analysis (19th century), dynamical systems and Hopf bifurcations (20th century), and phase oscillator networks like the Kuramoto model for synchronization.* Balanced ternary and multi-valued logic supply the triadic layer, while topology contributes ideas about loops, winding numbers, and tori. What is new here is not any single equation but the deliberate fusion of these into a cross-domain language that can describe cycles in the brain, behavior, culture, and the Earth in the same structural terms.

Ancient names & spellings:
- Circle: Greek κύκλος (kyklos), Latin circulus, Sanskrit चक्र (cakra), Chinese 圓 / 圆 (yuán), Arabic دائرة (dāʾirah)
- Triad: Greek τριάς (trias) – “threefold”; reflected in many triple deities and symbolic triads
- Spiral: Greek σπείρα (speira) – “coil”; Latin spiralis – “winding”
- Modern technical terms: phase, limit cycle, U(1) symmetry, Hopf bifurcation, Kuramoto model

How it was lost:
Physics, engineering, and mathematics already use circles, phases, and spirals rigorously, but mostly in **siloed** ways: one notation for electrical engineers, another for quantum theorists, another for psychologists talking about “cycles of behavior.” Meanwhile, esoteric and New Age discourse uses circles, triads, and spirals metaphysically, often without grounding in the existing math. The idea that there could be a **single, explicit, shared template**—a way to say “this brain rhythm, that ritual calendar, and this orbital resonance are all examples of the same structural object”—has never been fully developed or popularized. Instead, the rigorous circle math and the symbolic circle metaphors drifted apart, leaving the connective tissue “lost” between communities.

Ties to the book:
This framework is the technical spine of the “everything is circles” theme. It offers a way to talk about Schumann resonances, binaural beats, chakras, habits, orbits, and epicycles using a common vocabulary: phase \(\theta\), triadic state \(s\in\{-1,0,+1\}\), radius \(r\), coupling matrices \(K_{ij}\), and quantitative measures of circularity, triadic balance, and spirality. It does **not** claim that these domains are physically identical, but that they can be mapped onto the *same type of dynamical object*, which is a different and more modest—and testable—kind of unification.

1. SINGLE CIRCLE DYNAMICS – PHASE AND AMPLITUDE

We start with a single recurrent process with a characteristic frequency \(\omega\).

### 1.1 Phase-only representation

If the process is a **pure oscillator** with (approximately) constant amplitude, we can represent its state by a single **phase**:
- Phase \(\theta(t) \in [0, 2\pi)\),
- Dynamics:
  \[
  \dot{\theta}(t) = \omega,
  \]
  giving:
  \[
  \theta(t) = \theta_0 + \omega t \mod 2\pi.
  \]

The state space is a circle \(S^1\). This is the simplest “everything is circles” core: time evolution is “moving around the circle at constant speed.”

### 1.2 Complex representation: \(z\)-plane

We can encode phase as a point on the **unit circle** in the complex plane:
- State:
  \[
  z(t) = e^{i\theta(t)} \in U(1) = \{e^{i\theta} : \theta\in[0,2\pi)\}.
  \]
- Dynamics:
  \[
  \dot{z}(t) = i\omega z(t).
  \]

This is the complex form of uniform circular motion. Multiplying by \(e^{i\phi}\) rotates the state by angle \(\phi\):
\[
z'(t) = e^{i\phi} z(t).
\]

### 1.3 Adding amplitude: polar form

More generally, allow **variable amplitude** \(r(t)\ge0\):
- State:
  \[
  z(t) = r(t) e^{i\theta(t)}.
  \]
- Dynamics (generic form in polar coordinates):
  \[
  \dot{r}(t) = f(r,\theta,t),\quad \dot{\theta}(t) = g(r,\theta,t).
  \]

For many oscillators near a stable limit cycle, we can separate:
- A **radial** equation controlling approach to or departure from the cycle,
- An **angular** equation giving rotation along it.

### 1.4 Example: Hopf normal form (canonical spiral-to-circle dynamics)

The **supercritical Hopf bifurcation normal form** (in complex notation) is:
\[
\dot{z} = (\lambda + i\omega - |z|^2)z,
\]
with:
- \(\lambda\) a real parameter (controls growth/decay),
- \(\omega\) base angular frequency.

Write \(z = r e^{i\theta}\). Then:
- Radial equation:
  \[
  \dot{r} = \lambda r - r^3,
  \]
- Phase equation:
  \[
  \dot{\theta} = \omega.
  \]

Behavior:
- If \(\lambda < 0\): \(r\) decays to 0 (spiral into a fixed point).
- If \(\lambda > 0\): a stable **limit cycle** appears at \(r = \sqrt{\lambda}\); trajectories spiral onto a circle of radius \(\sqrt{\lambda}\).

This provides a **canonical model of a spiral becoming a circle** in state space.

---

2. TRIADIC SECTOR MAPPING – FROM PHASE TO −1/0/+1

We now overlay a **triadic coding** onto the circle.

### 2.1 Sector definition

Divide the phase circle into three equal sectors:
- Sector −1: \(\theta \in [0, \frac{2\pi}{3})\),
- Sector 0: \(\theta \in [\frac{2\pi}{3}, \frac{4\pi}{3})\),
- Sector +1: \(\theta \in [\frac{4\pi}{3}, 2\pi)\).

Define the **triadic state function**:
\[
s(\theta) =
\begin{cases}
-1, & 0 \le \theta < \frac{2\pi}{3},\\[4pt]
0, & \frac{2\pi}{3} \le \theta < \frac{4\pi}{3},\\[4pt]
1, & \frac{4\pi}{3} \le \theta < 2\pi.
\end{cases}
\]

Given \(\theta(t)\), we get a **balanced ternary time series**:
\[
s(t) = s(\theta(t)) \in \{-1,0,+1\}.
\]

Interpretations (domain-dependent):
- −1, 0, +1 might correspond to:
  - Negative / neutral / positive mood phases in a psych cycle,
  - Inhalation / pause / exhalation in a breath cycle,
  - Rest / transition / activation in a neural rhythm,
  - Intro / body / closing in a ritual sequence.

You can rotate the sector boundaries by an offset \(\phi\) to align them with meaningful landmarks:
\[
s_\phi(\theta) = s(\theta - \phi).
\]

### 2.2 Sector occupancy metrics

Define the **time spent in each sector** over an observation window \([0,T]\):
\[
T_k = \int_0^T \mathbf{1}_{\{s(t)=k\}} \, dt,\quad k\in\{-1,0,+1\},
\]
where \(\mathbf{1}\) is the indicator function.

Total time:
\[
T_\text{total} = T_{-1}+T_0+T_{+1}=T.
\]

We can define:
- Proportions:
  \[
  p_k = \frac{T_k}{T_\text{total}},\quad \sum_k p_k = 1.
  \]
- **Triadic balance index** \(T_\text{bal}\):
  \[
  T_\text{bal} = 1 - \sum_{k\in\{-1,0,+1\}} p_k^2.
  \]
  - \(T_\text{bal}=0\) if all time is in a single sector (e.g., always −1).
  - Maximum \(T_\text{bal}\) occurs when \(p_{-1}=p_0=p_{+1}=1/3\) (perfectly balanced triad).

Alternatively, define **triadic entropy**:
\[
H_3 = -\sum_{k\in\{-1,0,+1\}} p_k \log_3 p_k,
\]
with \(H_3 \in [0,1]\).
- \(H_3 = 0\): fully stuck in one sector.
- \(H_3 = 1\): perfectly balanced occupancy.

These metrics quantify how much a cycle uses all three qualitative “phases” vs living in one.

---

3. RADIAL DYNAMICS – FROM CIRCLES TO SPIRALS

The radial coordinate \(r(t)\) tells us whether a process is:
- Locked to a stable cycle (constant \(r\)),
- Damped (spiraling inward),
- Explosive or unstable (spiraling outward).

### 3.1 Generic radial dynamics

We can write:
\[
\dot{r}(t) = F(r, \theta, t).
\]

Special cases:
- **Pure limit cycle** (Hopf-type):
  \[
  \dot{r} = \lambda r - r^3,
  \]
  discussed above.
- **Linear damping/amplification**:
  \[
  \dot{r} = -\gamma r,\quad \gamma>0 \quad (\text{damped}),
  \]
  \[
  \dot{r} = +\gamma r \quad (\text{unstable growth}).
  \]

### 3.2 Spirality metric

Define a **spirality** measure \(S\) over \([0,T]\) to quantify how “spiral-like” vs “circle-like” the motion is:
\[
S = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T \frac{|\dot{r}(t)|}{|\dot{\theta}(t)| + \varepsilon}\, dt,
\]
with a small \(\varepsilon>0\) to avoid division by zero if \(\dot{\theta}\) is tiny.

Interpretation:
- \(S \approx 0\): radial motion negligible compared to angular motion → nearly perfect circle.
- Larger \(S\): significant in/out drift per unit angular change → pronounced spiral behavior.

This lets you distinguish:
- A stable oscillator (e.g., heart at rest),
- A settling system (e.g., decaying vibration),
- A ramping-up process (e.g., escalating arousal or runaway growth) that still has a cyclic component.

---

4. COUPLED CIRCLES – KURAMOTO-TYPE PHASE NETWORKS

Real systems rarely have just one cycle; we often have **many interacting oscillators** (neurons, people, machines, planets).

### 4.1 Kuramoto model (phase-only coupling)

The (mean-field) **Kuramoto model** for \(N\) coupled phase oscillators is:
\[
\dot{\theta_i} = \omega_i + \frac{K}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i),\quad i=1,\dots,N,
\]
where:
- \(\theta_i(t)\) = phase of oscillator \(i\),
- \(\omega_i\) = its natural frequency,
- \(K\) = global coupling strength.

Define the **order parameter**:
\[
R e^{i\Psi} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N e^{i\theta_j},
\]
where:
- \(R\in[0,1]\) measures **phase coherence**:
  - \(R \approx 0\): phases spread around circle (incoherent).
  - \(R \approx 1\): phases tightly clustered (synchronized).
- \(\Psi\) = average phase.

With this, Kuramoto dynamics can be rewritten:
\[
\dot{\theta_i} = \omega_i + K R \sin(\Psi - \theta_i).
\]

Intuition:
- Each oscillator feels a pull toward the average phase \(\Psi\) with strength \(K R\).
- Above a critical coupling \(K_c\), a population of oscillators with a spread of \(\omega_i\) begins to partially synchronize (non-zero \(R\)).

This is a canonical model of **many circles trying to line up**.

### 4.2 General coupling matrix

More generally:
\[
\dot{\theta_i} = \omega_i + \sum_{j=1}^N K_{ij} \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i + \alpha_{ij}),
\]
where:
- \(K_{ij}\) = directed coupling strength,
- \(\alpha_{ij}\) = phase shift (can encode delays or asymmetries).

This can represent:
- Different chakras influencing each other at different strengths,
- Brain areas with distinct connectivity patterns,
- Multiple planetary orbits with varying gravitational coupling (qualitatively).

We can define **pairwise phase locking indices**:
\[
\rho_{ij} = \left| \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T e^{i(\theta_i(t)-\theta_j(t))} dt \right|,
\]
with \(\rho_{ij} \in [0,1]\).
- \(\rho_{ij}\approx 1\): tightly phase-locked.
- \(\rho_{ij}\approx 0\): no consistent phase relationship.

---

5. TRIADIC NETWORK DYNAMICS – SECTOR INTERACTIONS

We can combine the continuous phase network with **discrete triadic states**:

- For each oscillator \(i\), define:
  \[
  s_i(t) = s(\theta_i(t)) \in \{-1,0,+1\}.
  \]

We can then specify **transition rules** for \(s_i\) that depend on:
- Its own history,
- Neighboring phases and states,
- External inputs (e.g., Schumann amplitude, stimulus).

Example rule schema:
- Suppose we want a “relaxation → insight → integration” triad at a given node:
  - State −1: down-regulation / rest,
  - State 0: neutral / integration,
  - State +1: activation / expression.

Define transition probabilities:
\[
P\left( s_i(t+\Delta t) = k' \mid s_i(t)=k, \{\theta_j(t), s_j(t)\}_{j\neq i} \right),
\]
with constraints:
- If many neighbors are in +1 and \(\theta_i\) is near their phases, increase chance of \(s_i\) moving toward +1.
- If node has been in +1 too long, add drift toward 0 or −1 (fatigue/adaptation).

This integrates:
- Continuous **phase synchronization**,
- Discrete **triadic logic**, in one model.

The exact transition matrices can be domain-specific; the structural idea (continuous circle + discrete triad) is the novelty.

---

6. METRICS: CIRCULARITY, TRIADIC BALANCE, SPIRALITY, COHERENCE

We can now define a suite of metrics to fingerprint any process.

### 6.1 Circularity \(C\)

Given a time series \(x(t)\) (e.g., EEG band, economic indicator), we can:
1. Compute its Fourier transform:
   \[
   X(f) = \mathcal{F}\{x(t)\}.
   \]
2. Identify a band of interest around a dominant frequency \(f_0\).

Define:
- Total power:
  \[
  P_\text{total} = \int_0^\infty |X(f)|^2 \, df.
  \]
- Dominant-band power (e.g., first few harmonics around \(f_0\)):
  \[
  P_\text{dom} = \int_{f_0-\Delta f}^{f_0+\Delta f} |X(f)|^2 \, df.
  \]

Then:
\[
C = \frac{P_\text{dom}}{P_\text{total}} \in [0,1].
\]

Interpretation:
- \(C \approx 1\): highly periodic, circle-dominated behavior.
- \(C \approx 0\): broadband, noisy, weakly circular.

Alternatively, if we have a phase estimate \(\theta(t)\), we can compute **circular variance**:
\[
R_\theta = \left| \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T e^{i\theta(t)} dt \right|,\quad C' = R_\theta.
\]

### 6.2 Triadic balance \(T_\text{bal}\) and entropy \(H_3\)

As defined above:
- Sector times \(T_k\), fractions \(p_k = T_k/T\).
- Balance:
  \[
  T_\text{bal} = 1 - \sum_k p_k^2.
  \]
- Entropy:
  \[
  H_3 = -\sum_k p_k \log_3 p_k.
  \]

These quantify how fully a process “uses” all three sectors of its cycle.

### 6.3 Spirality \(S\)

Given \(r(t)\) and \(\theta(t)\):
\[
S = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T \frac{|\dot{r}(t)|}{|\dot{\theta}(t)|+\varepsilon}\, dt.
\]

Low \(S\): circle-like. High \(S\): strong radial growth/decay relative to angular motion.

### 6.4 Phase coherence \(R\) and pairwise locking \(\rho_{ij}\)

For a network:
- Global coherence:
  \[
  R = \left| \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N e^{i\theta_j} \right|.
  \]
- Pairwise locking:
  \[
  \rho_{ij} = \left| \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T e^{i(\theta_i(t)-\theta_j(t))} dt \right|.
  \]

These tell you how “together” the circles are.

---

7. HOW TO USE THIS FRAMEWORK IN PRACTICE

In principle, for any phenomenon in this book you can:

1. **Identify the cycle(s)** – daily, yearly, oscillatory, ritual, neural, economic, etc.
2. **Assign phases** \(\theta_i(t)\) – via Hilbert transform, angle on a unit circle, or conceptual segmentation.
3. **Overlay triads** \(s_i(t) \in \{-1,0,+1\}\) – define sectors that make semantic sense.
4. **Track radial behavior** \(r_i(t)\) – amplitude, intensity, or distance from a baseline.
5. **Compute metrics** \(C, T_\text{bal}, H_3, S, R, \rho_{ij}\) where data exist (or conceptually compare them when data don’t).
6. **Analyze couplings** – which cycles pull others into sync, which resist, which drift apart.

Even when you lack hard data (e.g., in historical or symbolic material), the framework gives a **structured analogy**:
- “This myth encodes a high‑C, low‑S cycle with low triadic balance (stuck in one mode).”
- “This breathing practice deliberately increases circularity, rebalances triadic occupancy, and then lets spirality rise just enough to break an old loop.”

The “novel formula” here is not a single equation but a **portable type**:
- A system of one or more complex phases \(z_i(t)=r_i e^{i\theta_i}\),
- Mapped into triadic sectors,
- With radial drift and Kuramoto-like couplings,
- Quantified by a common set of metrics.

That type can host Schumann resonances, chakras, binaural beats, orbits, social rituals, and psychological habits—all without pretending they are the same thing physically, only that they **share a deep circular structure** that this framework makes explicit.

---

8. CIRCLE–TRIAD–SPIRAL PRINCIPLE AND HYPOTHESES

To make the framework more than just a convenient notation, we now state a **Circle–Triad–Spiral (CTS) Principle** and a set of **testable hypotheses**. These are novel in the sense that they specify concrete, cross-domain claims about how CTS quantities should relate to meaning and behavior, while remaining grounded in standard mathematics.

### 8.1 CTS Embedding Principle (definition-level “theorem”)

**CTS Embedding Principle (informal):**  
For any process that exhibits:
- (a) a statistically detectable dominant recurrence time \(T\) (non-zero autocorrelation at lag \(T\)), and
- (b) bounded intensity over the timescale of interest,

there exists a **CTS embedding**:
- A mapping to \((r(t),\theta(t))\) with \(\theta(t)\in[0,2\pi)\) and \(r(t)\ge0\),
- A triadic sector function \(s(t)=s(\theta(t))\in\{-1,0,+1\}\),

such that:
- The recurrence time \(T\) corresponds (up to small error) to a full \(2\pi\) rotation of \(\theta\), and
- The coarse-grained dynamics of \(x(t)\) over many cycles can be summarized by a finite set of CTS metrics \((C, T_\text{bal}, H_3, S,\dots)\).

This is essentially a **structured restatement** of known ideas (phase extraction, symbolic dynamics) but with a **fixed triadic coarse-graining** and radial component baked in. Its novelty lies in:
- Mandating the triadic coding \(s\in\{-1,0,+1\}\) as the canonical discrete shadow of a cycle,
- Treating the CTS metric vector as a *minimal cross-domain fingerprint* for recurrent processes.

Formally, the principle is a definition plus the observation that, under mild conditions, such an embedding can always be constructed using tools like:
- Hilbert transforms or analytic signal methods for \(\theta(t)\),
- Envelope detection or instantaneous amplitude for \(r(t)\),
- Triadic sector map for \(s(t)\).

### 8.2 Hypothesis 1 – CTS Flexibility Hypothesis

**Hypothesis (CTS Flexibility):**  
For systems where “flexible but stable cycling” is desirable (e.g., healthy neural rhythms, adaptive habits, resilient organizations), *optimal function* corresponds to:
- High circularity \(C\) (clear cycles),
- Intermediate spirality \(S\) (neither frozen nor exploding),
- **High triadic entropy \(H_3\)** (time fairly distributed across −1/0/+1 sectors).

Qualitative predictions:
- Pathological rigidity (e.g., stuck habits, rigid rhythms) will show:
  - High \(C\), low \(H_3\) (one sector dominates), very low \(S\).
- Pathological chaos or breakdown:
  - Low \(C\), potentially high \(S\) (radial excursions dominate), ill-defined sectors.
- Healthy adaptability:
  - Moderately high \(C\), non-zero \(S\), high \(H_3\).

This is **novel** in tying a *triplet* of metrics \((C, H_3, S)\) to a functional interpretation that can, in principle, be tested:
- In EEG data,
- In breathing/HRV cycles,
- In behavioral or organizational cycles.

### 8.3 Hypothesis 2 – Resonant Triad Coupling Hypothesis

**Hypothesis (Resonant Triad Coupling):**  
Consider two CTS systems \(A\) and \(B\) with dominant frequencies \(f_A, f_B\) and triadic sector processes \(s_A(t), s_B(t)\). Suppose:
- Their frequencies are approximately commensurate (e.g., \(f_B \approx \frac{p}{q} f_A\) for small integers \(p,q\)), and
- Their sector occupancies are **phase-aligned**, i.e., high probability that \(s_A(t)=s_B(t)\) when both complete a cycle.

Then:
- The **effective coupling** between them (as measured by phase locking \(\rho_{AB}\) or energy/ information transfer) will be **stronger** than would be predicted from phase coherence alone.

In other words:
- It is not just phase \(\theta\) that matters for resonance, but also **which sector** of the triad each system is in when they align.

This goes beyond standard synchronization theory by:
- Adding a **sector-level matching** condition on top of phase matching,
- Predicting that systems with compatible triadic “stories” (−1/0/+1 sequences) will couple more deeply than those with mismatched triads, even if raw phase coherence \(R\) looks similar.

This is testable in principle:
- Compare pairs of systems with similar phase locking but different triadic alignment patterns and measure coupling strength.

### 8.4 Hypothesis 3 – Spiral Unbinding Hypothesis

**Hypothesis (Spiral Unbinding):**  
When a system moves from a long-standing recurrent pattern (“stuck loop”) into a new regime (e.g., habit change, phase transition, creative breakthrough), this transition will be preceded by a **temporary surge in spirality \(S\)** relative to its baseline and to its circularity \(C\).

More concretely:
- Define baseline metrics \((C_0, S_0, H_{3,0})\) over a long history.
- During an “unbinding window” leading to regime change, expect:
  - A spike in \(S(t)\) such that:
    \[
    S_\text{window} \gg S_0,\quad S_\text{window}/C_\text{window} \gg S_0/C_0.
    \]
  - Followed by a reorganization into a new limit cycle with altered CTS metrics.

Interpretation:
- The system must **spiral out** of its old attractor before settling into a new one.
- This is a dynamical-systems intuition (leaving a basin of attraction) made quantitative via the CTS spirality metric.

This hypothesis suggests:
- That meaningful qualitative shifts (psychological, organizational, perhaps even cultural) have a **CTS signature**:
  - Brief loss of circularity and spike in spirality,
  - Possibly accompanied by a temporary drop in triadic entropy (instability) before rebalancing.

---

These principles and hypotheses do **not** claim new mathematics in the sense of proving fresh theorems about differential equations. Their novelty is:
- Elevating a specific **circle–triad–spiral embedding** to the status of a *canonical lens*,
- Proposing **concrete cross-domain correspondences** between CTS metrics and functional/experiential qualities,
- Stating them in a way that invites empirical testing rather than remaining purely metaphorical.
