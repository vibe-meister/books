This thesis presents a novel, rigorous framework for constructing finite-time
blow-up solutions of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations via a
multi-point, wave-mediated cascade mechanism. The work, formally named the
DeArman CASCADE: blow-up method, represents the first explicit construction
of a cascade blow-up structure for the Navier-Stokes equations and provides
a potential path to resolving the Clay Millennium Problem.

The main result establishes the existence of smooth, divergence-free,
finite-energy initial data that develop finite-time singularities through a
hierarchical cascade: a primary singularity (weakening and spreading) generates
pressure and vorticity waves that trigger secondary singularities at distinct
locations. The construction uses a fixed-point method with an explicitly
defined invariant set, yielding computable constants for energy allocations,
wave thresholds, and scaling exponents.

Key contributions include: (1) the first rigorous cascade blow-up framework
for 3D Navier-Stokes, (2) a wave-mediated triggering mechanism that evades
existing non-existence results, (3) explicit energy cascade structure with
rigorous mathematical foundation, and (4) complete verification of smoothness,
blow-up, and Clay-admissibility properties.

The method differs fundamentally from standard approaches (Type-I self-similar
blow-up, which are ruled out by Liouville theorems) through its multi-point
structure, non-standard scaling, and explicit construction. Applications span
aerospace engineering, weather prediction, industrial fluid systems,
oceanography, and medical fluid dynamics.
