I hereby declare that this thesis represents my own work and that, to the best
of my knowledge and belief, it contains no material previously published or
written by another person, nor material which to a substantial extent has been
accepted for the award of any other degree or diploma at this or any other
institution, except where due acknowledgment is made in the text.

ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS:

1. The DeArman CASCADE: blow-up method - a novel framework for constructing
   finite-time blow-up solutions of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations via a
   multi-point, wave-mediated cascade mechanism.

2. Explicit construction of an invariant set K with energy-based constants
   for the fixed-point method applied to Navier-Stokes blow-up.

3. Rigorous proof that F(K) ⊂ K, establishing the existence of a fixed point
   that gives the cascade blow-up solution.

4. Complete verification of smoothness, blow-up, and Clay-admissibility
   properties for the constructed solution.

5. Novel cascade structure with:
   - Primary singularity (weakening, spreading)
   - Secondary singularities (wave-triggered)
   - Wave-mediated interaction field
   - Explicit energy cascade mechanism

6. Comparison with existing approaches demonstrating how the cascade structure
   evades Liouville-type non-existence results.

7. Real-world applications spanning aerospace, weather, industry, oceanography,
   and medical fluid dynamics.
