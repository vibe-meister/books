the best move is the one your opponent doesn't see coming

every resource spent is an opportunity cost

luck favors the prepared player

sometimes the optimal play is to make your opponent's optimal play suboptimal

the game isn't won in the opening, but it can be lost there

positioning beats possession

information is a resource

the player who adapts fastest wins

control the tempo, control the game

every decision is a commitment
