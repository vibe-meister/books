CHAPTER 4: THE PHYSICS OF ANEUTRONIC FUSION

Plasma Physics Fundamentals

Fusion occurs in a state of matter called plasma—a hot, ionized gas where electrons have been stripped from atoms, creating a soup of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. Understanding plasma physics is essential to understanding fusion.

**Plasma Properties:**
- **Ionization**: At fusion temperatures (millions of degrees), all atoms are fully ionized. A hydrogen plasma consists of protons and free electrons.
- **Quasi-neutrality**: Although plasmas contain charged particles, they are approximately neutral overall—the total positive charge roughly equals the total negative charge.
- **Collective Behavior**: Charged particles in plasma interact through long-range electromagnetic forces, not just collisions. This creates collective effects like waves, instabilities, and self-organization.

**Plasma Parameters:**
Key parameters that describe a fusion plasma include:
- **Temperature (T)**: Usually measured in electron-volts (eV) or kelvin. 1 eV = 11,604 K. Fusion requires temperatures of 10-100 keV (100 million to 1 billion degrees Celsius).
- **Density (n)**: Number of particles per cubic meter. Typical fusion plasmas have densities of 10²⁰ to 10²⁴ particles/m³.
- **Confinement Time (τ)**: How long the plasma maintains its energy. This can range from nanoseconds (inertial confinement) to seconds (magnetic confinement).
- **Beta (β)**: Ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure. β = 2μ₀nkT/B², where B is the magnetic field strength.

Temperature and Density Requirements

For fusion to occur, two nuclei must overcome their mutual electrostatic repulsion (the Coulomb barrier) and get close enough for the strong nuclear force to bind them together. This requires:

1. **High Temperature**: Particles must have enough kinetic energy to overcome the Coulomb barrier. The required temperature depends on the specific reaction:
   - D-T fusion: ~10-20 keV (100-200 million °C)
   - D-³He fusion: ~20-40 keV (200-400 million °C)
   - p-11B fusion: ~60-100 keV (600 million to 1 billion °C)

2. **High Density**: More particles mean more collisions and more fusion reactions. However, higher density also increases pressure, making confinement more difficult.

3. **Long Confinement Time**: The plasma must stay hot and dense long enough for significant fusion to occur.

The product of density and confinement time (nτ) is a key figure of merit. For net energy gain, nτ must exceed a critical value that depends on temperature and the specific reaction.

**Maxwellian Distribution:**
At thermal equilibrium, particle velocities follow a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Even at fusion temperatures, most particles have energies well below the peak fusion cross-section energy. However, the high-energy tail of the distribution contains particles with sufficient energy for fusion. This is why fusion can occur at temperatures below the peak cross-section energy.

Confinement Challenges

Plasma at fusion temperatures cannot be contained by material walls—it would instantly vaporize them. Instead, fusion plasmas must be confined using:

1. **Magnetic Confinement**: Charged particles spiral along magnetic field lines. By creating closed magnetic field configurations (like tokamaks or stellarators), the plasma can be confined away from walls.

2. **Inertial Confinement**: A small fuel pellet is compressed and heated so rapidly that fusion occurs before the plasma can expand. This is typically done with powerful lasers.

**Magnetic Confinement:**
In a magnetic field, charged particles follow helical paths along field lines. The radius of this motion (Larmor radius) is:
r_L = mv_⊥ / (qB)

Where:
- m = particle mass
- v_⊥ = velocity perpendicular to magnetic field
- q = particle charge
- B = magnetic field strength

For fusion plasmas, the Larmor radius is typically millimeters to centimeters. The challenge is creating magnetic field configurations that keep particles confined for long enough.

**Plasma Instabilities:**
Fusion plasmas are prone to various instabilities that can disrupt confinement:
- **MHD (Magnetohydrodynamic) instabilities**: Large-scale distortions of the plasma
- **Micro-instabilities**: Small-scale turbulence that increases transport
- **Disruptions**: Sudden loss of confinement, potentially damaging the reactor

**Energy Loss Mechanisms:**
Even when confined, plasmas lose energy through:
- **Radiation**: Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron radiation, line radiation
- **Conduction**: Heat transport along temperature gradients
- **Convection**: Plasma flows and turbulence
- **Particle loss**: Particles escaping the confinement region

Bremsstrahlung Radiation

Bremsstrahlung (German for "braking radiation") is electromagnetic radiation emitted when charged particles are accelerated or decelerated. In fusion plasmas, this occurs when electrons are deflected by the electric fields of ions.

**Bremsstrahlung Power:**
The power radiated through bremsstrahlung is approximately:
P_br ≈ 1.69 × 10⁻³² n_e n_i Z² T_e^(1/2) W/m³

Where:
- n_e = electron density
- n_i = ion density
- Z = ion charge number
- T_e = electron temperature (in eV)

For p-11B fusion, this is particularly problematic because:
1. Boron has Z = 5 (high charge)
2. High temperatures mean high electron velocities
3. The bremsstrahlung power can exceed the fusion power unless the plasma is very hot and dense

**The Bremsstrahlung Problem:**
For p-11B fusion to be viable, the fusion power must exceed the bremsstrahlung losses. This requires:
- Very high temperatures (to increase fusion rate)
- Very high densities (to increase fusion rate)
- Or techniques to reduce electron-ion collisions

Some proposed solutions include:
- Using non-Maxwellian particle distributions (beam-target fusion)
- Reducing electron temperature relative to ion temperature
- Using magnetic fields to reduce electron-ion collisions

Reaction Rates and Cross-Sections

The rate at which fusion reactions occur depends on the reaction cross-section and the relative velocities of the colliding particles.

**Reaction Rate:**
For a plasma with two ion species (densities n₁ and n₂), the fusion reaction rate per unit volume is:
R = n₁ n₂ ⟨σv⟩

Where ⟨σv⟩ is the average of the product of cross-section and relative velocity over the velocity distribution.

**Cross-Section:**
The fusion cross-section σ depends on the center-of-mass energy E. It follows a characteristic curve:
- At low energies: σ is very small (Coulomb barrier prevents reactions)
- At intermediate energies: σ increases rapidly
- At peak energy: σ reaches maximum
- At high energies: σ decreases (particles move too fast to interact)

The cross-section can be approximated using the Gamow formula, which accounts for both the Coulomb barrier and the probability of quantum tunneling.

**Maxwell-Averaged Reaction Rate:**
For a Maxwellian velocity distribution at temperature T, the reaction rate parameter is:
⟨σv⟩ = (8/πm_r)^(1/2) (kT)^(-3/2) ∫₀^∞ σ(E) E exp(-E/kT) dE

Where m_r is the reduced mass of the two-particle system.

This integral must be evaluated numerically for each reaction. The result shows that ⟨σv⟩ increases with temperature, but the increase is slower than linear due to the exponential factor.

**Power Density:**
The fusion power density (power per unit volume) is:
P_f = n₁ n₂ ⟨σv⟩ E_f

Where E_f is the energy released per fusion reaction.

For net energy gain, P_f must exceed the power losses (radiation, conduction, etc.) plus the power needed to maintain the plasma.

The physics of aneutronic fusion is complex, involving plasma dynamics, nuclear physics, and electromagnetic theory. But understanding these fundamentals is essential to developing practical aneutronic fusion reactors. The next chapter will explore the advantages and challenges in more detail.
