CHAPTER 3: ANEUTRONIC FUSION REACTIONS

Proton-Boron-11 (p-11B) Fusion

The proton-boron-11 reaction is perhaps the most promising aneutronic fusion pathway. The reaction is:

p + ¹¹B → 3 ⁴He + 8.7 MeV

This reaction produces three alpha particles, each carrying approximately 2.9 MeV of kinetic energy. The reaction has several attractive features:

**Advantages:**
- Completely aneutronic (no neutrons produced)
- Abundant fuel: hydrogen (protons) is everywhere, and boron-11 makes up 80% of natural boron
- Natural boron is relatively common (found in borax, kernite, and other minerals)
- All reaction products are charged particles (alpha particles)
- No radioactive waste production
- The alpha particles can be used for direct energy conversion

**Challenges:**
- Extremely high temperature requirement: 600 million to 1 billion degrees Celsius (60-100 keV)
- Bremsstrahlung radiation losses are significant at these temperatures
- The reaction cross-section is relatively small compared to D-T fusion
- Requires very high plasma density and long confinement times

**Reaction Cross-Section:**
The cross-section for p-11B fusion peaks at around 600 keV center-of-mass energy, which corresponds to a temperature of approximately 6.9 billion degrees Celsius. However, the reaction can occur at lower temperatures, though with reduced efficiency. The cross-section at 100 keV (about 1.16 billion degrees Celsius) is approximately 0.01 barns, compared to D-T fusion which has a cross-section of about 5 barns at its peak energy of 64 keV.

**Energy Distribution:**
The 8.7 MeV total energy is distributed among the three alpha particles. Due to conservation of momentum and energy, the alpha particles are not emitted with equal energies. The energy distribution depends on the reaction mechanism, but typically two alpha particles receive most of the energy while the third receives less.

Deuterium-Helium-3 (D-³He) Fusion

The deuterium-helium-3 reaction is:

D + ³He → ⁴He + p + 18.3 MeV

This reaction produces an alpha particle (3.6 MeV) and a proton (14.7 MeV). However, this reaction is not purely aneutronic because deuterium can also react with itself:

D + D → ³He + n + 3.27 MeV (50% probability)
D + D → T + p + 4.03 MeV (50% probability)

The tritium (T) produced can then react with deuterium:
D + T → ⁴He + n + 17.6 MeV

So while D-³He fusion can be mostly aneutronic if the plasma is pure D-³He, in practice some neutron production occurs due to D-D side reactions.

**Advantages:**
- High energy yield (18.3 MeV per reaction)
- Lower temperature requirement than p-11B (200-400 million degrees Celsius)
- Helium-3 is stable (unlike tritium)
- Most energy carried by charged particles

**Challenges:**
- Helium-3 is extremely rare on Earth (must be extracted from lunar regolith or produced from tritium decay)
- D-D side reactions produce neutrons
- Requires careful fuel mixture control to minimize neutron production

**Helium-3 Availability:**
Natural helium-3 on Earth is extremely rare—only about 0.0001% of natural helium. However, helium-3 is more abundant on the Moon, where it has been deposited by solar wind over billions of years. Estimates suggest the lunar surface contains hundreds of thousands of tons of helium-3, which could potentially power Earth for thousands of years if extraction becomes economically viable.

Helium-3-Helium-3 (³He-³He) Fusion

The helium-3-helium-3 reaction is:

³He + ³He → ⁴He + 2p + 12.9 MeV

This reaction produces an alpha particle and two protons, all charged particles. It's completely aneutronic.

**Advantages:**
- Completely aneutronic
- All products are charged particles
- No radioactive materials involved

**Challenges:**
- Even rarer fuel than D-³He (requires pure ³He)
- High temperature requirement (400-600 million degrees Celsius)
- Lower energy yield than D-³He
- Same fuel availability issues as D-³He

Other Aneutronic Reactions

Several other aneutronic or low-neutron reactions have been proposed:

**Lithium-6-Proton (⁶Li-p):**
⁶Li + p → ³He + ⁴He + 4.02 MeV

This reaction produces only charged particles but has a very low cross-section and requires high temperatures.

**Deuterium-Lithium-6 (D-⁶Li):**
D + ⁶Li → 2 ⁴He + 22.4 MeV

This reaction is mostly aneutronic but can have side reactions that produce neutrons.

**Proton-Lithium-7 (p-⁷Li):**
p + ⁷Li → 2 ⁴He + 17.3 MeV

This reaction is aneutronic but has a very low cross-section.

Reaction Cross-Sections and Energy Yields

The cross-section of a fusion reaction determines how likely it is to occur at a given energy. Cross-sections are typically measured in barns (1 barn = 10⁻²⁸ m²). The cross-section depends on the energy of the colliding particles and follows a characteristic curve that peaks at a specific energy.

For comparison:
- **D-T fusion**: Peak cross-section ~5 barns at 64 keV
- **D-³He fusion**: Peak cross-section ~0.9 barns at 200 keV
- **p-11B fusion**: Peak cross-section ~0.01 barns at 600 keV
- **³He-³He fusion**: Peak cross-section ~0.7 barns at 1 MeV

The energy yield per reaction also varies:
- **D-T**: 17.6 MeV
- **D-³He**: 18.3 MeV
- **p-11B**: 8.7 MeV
- **³He-³He**: 12.9 MeV

However, the energy yield must be balanced against the reaction rate. D-T fusion has both a high cross-section and high energy yield, making it easier to achieve net energy gain. Aneutronic reactions have lower cross-sections, requiring higher temperatures and densities to achieve the same reaction rates.

The Lawson Criterion

For any fusion reaction to produce net energy, the plasma must satisfy the Lawson criterion:

nτ ≥ (12kT) / (⟨σv⟩E_f)

Where:
- n = plasma density (particles per cubic meter)
- τ = energy confinement time (seconds)
- k = Boltzmann constant
- T = plasma temperature (kelvin)
- ⟨σv⟩ = reaction rate parameter (depends on cross-section and particle velocities)
- E_f = energy released per fusion reaction (joules)

For p-11B fusion, the Lawson criterion is much more demanding than for D-T fusion due to the lower cross-section and higher temperature requirement. This means the plasma must be denser, hotter, or confined longer to achieve net energy gain.

Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of aneutronic fusion continue to drive research forward. The next chapter will explore the physics that governs these reactions and the conditions needed to make them work.
